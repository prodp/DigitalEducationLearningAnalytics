# Digital education and learning analytics


## Results
First an inherently practical and physical activity like muscular reinforcement seems to be easily taught with digital supports such as the FROG framework and video lectures. Additionally, a frame-based pedagogical model appears to work well in order to present complex exercises with multiple sub-steps, to the extent that students are able to transfer exercise-specific knowledge to other contexts.  All these claims are supported by the high degree of satisfaction of the expected learning goals. Second, the introduction of collaborative activities seems to have a positive effect on learning gains, thanks to the opportunity to verbalize the received information with a peer. This result supports the idea of introducing social activities in this kind of lectures. 
Overall, the project was able to answer all the research questions to different extents, which makes it a successful experiment.
