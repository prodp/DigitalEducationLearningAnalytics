The squat was correct, the pushup was not bad, the chaining was a little broken however","5","I think you followed all the guidelines of the videos... maybe I would keep the back a little straighter during pushup? Just slightly, otherwise good !","","","5","Well done Andre ! You did good, but maybe you did everything too fast? No need to rush, take your time and do a good execution"

Very smooth and precise !","3","Keep trying! It was not perfect, particularly the pushup. Maybe start with some repetitions on your knees to get used to the effort?","5","Nicely executed! Maybe a little too loose on the jump, you might want to control your movements"
"2019/01/08 7:34:47 AM CET","Andrea","2","Perfect squat! But still need to perfectionate the pushup and the all chaining. Well done however in choosing the easy version of the push up","6","Perfect I guess! I liked the performance, maybe better than the videos :P","4","Many points for dedication. But you need some exercise and rpetitions to master it correctly without shaking too much","",""

Try doing some repetitions from time to time to get used to the movements. But you followed the intructions, need to perfectionate","","","3","Luca, you could do better :P It was good, I think the hardest wa the push-up itself. You will get used to it. Pay attention at your hands distance, you might find a comfortable position","6","Just very well done. I think you did a nice job !"
