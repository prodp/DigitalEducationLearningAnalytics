The perfmance was not great, but we all start somewhere. You need to reinforce all your muscles to have the right excercise. Do not stop trying !","5","I liked it, but don't forget your back during the push-up"

But do not be down, just keep trying and you will do it. Maybe try the easy-version of the push-up next time","5","The chaining worked! Maybe try again the push-up to have a good performance. The push-up requires a lot of muscles together, sqeeze you buts next time :-P"

But all in all a very good performance","5","Pay attention to the squat, try to go slower and make the whole movement","2","Great motivation, but not enough. I suggest to re-peat each exercise on its own in order to master them better. The push-up need more control","",""
